The final test of the course, combine everything I've learned to make a 3D scene of my choice

Final Product:
The scene is about a mountain with a lake nearby. 
Buttons: Raining/stop raining, and rotating.
When rained, the scene will darken; when the raindrop hit the water, a ripple efect is created on the water surface. 
When the rain stopped, the scene will brighten.

Procedures:
1. Used Fractual Object, Scene Rotating, Sierpinski Triangle (sort of), Color Slider (sort of)
2. Make wave equation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation. Each ripple has a life time (how long the ripple before disappear),
fade (the further away fromt he source, the weaker the wave), decay(the ripple source is weaken over time), delay (travel time)
3. When the rain hit the water surface, add hit coordinate into ripple source, and remove it when ripple time run out.
