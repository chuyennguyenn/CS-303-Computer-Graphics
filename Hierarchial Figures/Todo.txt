Task: Making a figure using Hierarchy Modeling and animate it

Procedures:

1. Define Node: transform matrix vec4(), render method, sibling node, child node
Child-node's properties (strating position, scale) are their parent's
Sibling-nodes are independent of each siblings, except for starting position and scale, which are from their parent
One node can have many siblings, but can only have 1 parent and 1 child

2. Depends on the node, it can have up to 3 scaling value (width/size, height, depth) which is used for scale matrix 
to scale the object and a translate matrix to prevent them from overlapping each other 
Some node is rotated to look more appropiate (i.e the nose is a rectangle, which should point upward instead of outward cause 
I'm drawing a human figure not Pinocchio)

3. To animate, change and update corresponding node's angle value from time to time. 

4. Add light 

5. Add sliders to control each node's rotation, 
add buttons to start/stop the animation and to turn on/off light (despite the variable's name, it's actually not rotating at all)
