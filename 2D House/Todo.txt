Task: Make a 2D colored house

Procedures:
1. For triangle roof, using Sierpinski Triangle Algorithm but change from gl.drawArrays(gl.POINTS) to drawArray(gl.LINES) 
to fill all the space inside the triangle 

2. For the house's body, using the same Sierpinski Triangle Algorithm but now push 4 points instead of 3 into both 
positionArray and colorArray. Used drawArray(gl.LINES) instead of gl.drawArrays(gl.POINTS) to fill the color

3. The body is a rectangle, and I divided it into 4 parts: left wall, right wall, middle wall that connect 2 side walls 
(located on top of the door) and a door
